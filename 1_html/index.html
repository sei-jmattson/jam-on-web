            This is an example of an html document.

            HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is a way to add <i>metadata</i> to
            some data or information.  Then a program can use the metadata to display
            the data properly.  The most common HTML rendering program is a web
            browser.

            There are plenty of other sites that describe the various <i>elements</i>
            and <i>attributes</i> of HTML, which by the way, is a form of XML
            (eXtensible Markup Language).

            Notice how plain this page is?  Browser's have a very basic default style;
            they assume you will be adding your own style.  It is good to keep style
            separate. That way you, or other people, can make your page look different
            without actually having to change your page itself.
