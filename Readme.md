# jam-on-web

A web application primer.

This project is me dumping thoughts about web applications into a bit of tutorial.
I hope the progression will help people with no web experience establish the
building blocks necessary to develop robust applications.

Nothing is complete. One can use each block to spin off into deeper understanding
of the core and tangential topics.
