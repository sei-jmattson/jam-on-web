# NodeJs

### Overview
Node is popular; parting because it is javascript.  Since we use javascript for
code that runs on the browser, why not use javascript for the server side stuff
as well?

There are a lot of modules you can draw from too, using the Node Package Manager
(npm).

Express is one of them that makes running a server pretty simple.  This example
doesn't use it, but it might be a nice exercise to convert it!

### Run
For this you need to start the node server.  On a machine that has nodejs installed,
go to a terminal or command prompt and type `node server.js`.  Then browse to
`http://localhost:8080`.
